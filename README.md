# Reddit-Notify

Python script to provide updates on when new posts in specific subreddits are posted.

User can specify which subreddits, and which keywords to look for in the post titles.
Matching posts will be printed to console, along with an index. 
If the user enters an index, the corresponding post will be opened in default browser.

Begun building Django site, but decided to turn it into a Chrome extension instead.
Thus, Django production is halted indefinitely.
